# RaiseBuyLimit

###### Scary warning: Most of these addons were made long ago during Feenix days, then a lot was changed/added to prepare for Corecraft. Since it died, they still haven't been extensively tested on modern servers.

## Purpose:
This allows you to buy more than one stack of an item at once, including items that don't stack, items that come in batches (like 5x vials), and items costing different currencies.

When you change the quantity wanted, the item's price will change to show the total cost.

This also changes how input is handled on the split stack popup. Normally, if you have a stack of 20 and you type 99, the first 9 is shown but the 2nd is ignored because 99 is larger than 20. Now, typing 99 would cause the amount to change to 20.
